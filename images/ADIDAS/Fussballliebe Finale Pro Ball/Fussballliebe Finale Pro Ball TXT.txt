This product has been made with at least 50% renewable materials. Switching to renewable material sources offers more options to reduce our reliance on finite resources. We choose renewable materials because they are natural resources that can be planted and grownâ€¯again. This is unlike fossil fuel based materials, which once used, we cannot replenish.

Renewable materials are not only natural materials, but also bio-synthetic materials that have a plant feedstock instead of fossil fuel.

This feedstock is chemically processed into intermediate substances and is turned into synthetic materials in the end.
