Ur Mostro Communication
Men's Sneakers
New
$120.00
First released in 1999, the Mostro has become one of PUMA's best-selling shoes ever. Affectionally named after the Italian word for "monster", it was originally inspired by two sports shoes â€“ a sprinting spike from 1968 and a surfing shoe from the 80s. For those who dare to be bold, this latest version takes its name from the German prefix "Ur" which means something old or original. It has a somewhat more aggressive look with slightly longer spikes and a open mesh upper.
